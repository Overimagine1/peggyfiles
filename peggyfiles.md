# The Peggy Files
Welcome to The Peggy Files! We are dedicated to educating people on all of the different versions of JPEGMAFIA's albums, where to listen to them, and what's the quirks with each of them.

## FAQ
### How do I get the Bandcamp tracks for free? Im poor as shit not paying allat ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí∞
Click "Buy Digital Album" and put 0 dollars for the Name Your Price, then put your email (If you don't want to put your real email, you can use a service like [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/) or [Gmailnator](https://www.emailnator.com/)) and a fake zip code (I just did `12345`), click ok, then check your email.

### Is the Devon Hendryx archive account on streaming official?
No, the Devon Hendryx account is not official, the only official one is the one on [Bandcamp](https://dvonhendryx.bandcamp.com/). However, they claim on their Spotify page that no money is made or withdrawn from the releases, though there's no way of proving that. Despite it being fake, that doesn't mean you shouldn't listen to anything from that account, just keep in mind that it's not actually Peggy.

### How can I contribute/make changes to the list?
