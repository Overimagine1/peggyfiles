## FAQ
---
### How do I get the Bandcamp tracks for free? Im poor as shit not paying allat ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí∞
Click "Buy Digital Album" and put 0 dollars for the Name Your Price, then put your email (If you don't want to put your real email, you can use a service like [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/) or [Gmailnator](https://www.emailnator.com/)) and a fake zip code (I just did `12345`), click ok, then check your email.

### Is the Devon Hendryx archive account on streaming official?
No, the Devon Hendryx account is not official, the only official one is the one on [Bandcamp](https://dvonhendryx.bandcamp.com/). However, they claim on their Spotify page that no money is made or withdrawn from the releases, though there's no way of proving that. Despite it being fake, that doesn't mean you shouldn't listen to anything from that account, just keep in mind that it's not actually Peggy.

### How can I contribute/make changes to the list?
Shoot me a dm on Discord (`Overimagine#5133`) or [edit it on GitHub](https://github.com/Overimagine1/peggyfiles/edit/main/peggyfiles.md), then [send it as a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request).

## The List!

#### LP! (Offline)
On streaming, some of LP!'s songs is not in the album itself, which is why OFFLINE! was released later with the rest of the songs. There are playlists that make the album play how it's supposed to.

- [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/lp-offline/pl.u-gxblkM4T5D6Gar3)
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/19RNs5eXKd4WizXJ68WKik)
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQaGGFjucbg9wBMzUh7MBby5Cv_ezW67i) / [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQaGGFjucbg9wBMzUh7MBby5Cv_ezW67i)

#### EP2!
The full version is already available on streaming by default. You can find all the links to listen to it [here](https://songwhip.com/jpegmafia/ep2).

On some streaming services, the intro to FIX URSELF! is a separate song. It's not really an issue as it's the same thing, just separated.

PANIC ROOM! has a music video that's private on YouTube. You can watch it [here](https://archive.org/details/jpegmafia-panic-room) **(‚ö† NSFW ‚ö†)**. 
#### EP!
The full version is already available on streaming by default. You can find all the links to listen to it [here](https://songwhip.com/jpegmafia/ep).
#### All My Heroes Are Cornballs
AMHAC has a [normal version](https://songwhip.com/jpegmafia/all-my-heroes-are-cornballs) and a [director's cut version](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a_Cnh8_iu3kfwUozSWJW-POuau59OoBW) which is downloadable from Google Drive. I'd recommended you listen to the normal version (Which is already available in full on most streaming platforms) then the director's cut version.
#### Veteran
The full version is already available on streaming by default. You can find all the links to listen to it [here](https://songwhip.com/jpegmafia/veteran).
####  Black Ben Carson
Black Ben Carson has the original version, which you can stream on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDTq96UCKH8) and download from [MediaFire](https://www.mediafire.com/download/zl3vwcy82vj6jf3/BLACK+BEN+CARSON.zip). and the [2020 mix](https://songwhip.com/jpegmafia/blackbencarson) which is the one that's on most streaming services right now. The OG mix has some extra songs that the modern-day release doesn't have. Up to you on which one you wanna listen to.

You can stream it on [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/darkskin-manson_202204), [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/minteye/sets/darkskin-manson) (There are also downloads for this version), or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcbPoTQG2Y&list=PLXsOpcADjEVGNdxBL3phfD1M7I-rV4K6M) [(Music)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcbPoTQG2Y&list=PLXsOpcADjEVGNdxBL3phfD1M7I-rV4K6M)
