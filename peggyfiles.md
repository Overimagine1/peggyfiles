## FAQ
---
### How do I get the Bandcamp tracks for free? Im poor as shit not paying allat ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí∞
Click "Buy Digital Album" and put 0 dollars for the Name Your Price, then put your email (If you don't want to put your real email, you can use a service like [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/) or [Gmailnator](https://www.emailnator.com/)) and a fake zip code (I just did `12345`), click ok, then check your email.

### Is the Devon Hendryx archive account on streaming services official?
No, the Devon Hendryx account is not official, the only official one is the one on [Bandcamp](https://dvonhendryx.bandcamp.com/). However, they claim on their Spotify page that no money is made or withdrawn from the releases, though there's no way of proving that. Despite it being fake, that doesn't mean you shouldn't listen to anything from that account, just keep in mind that it's not actually Peggy.

### How do I local import on Spotify?

## The List!

### JPEGMAFIA

#### LP! (Offline)
LP! has the original version and the updated version. Both have very minor mixing differences, I personally find the updated version better.. On streaming, some of LP!'s songs is not in the album itself, which is why OFFLINE! was released later with the rest of the songs. There are playlists that make the album play how it's supposed to.

**Updated**
- [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/lp-offline/pl.u-gxblkM4T5D6Gar3) (Streaming)

#### EP2!
The full version is already available on streaming. On some streaming services, the intro to FIX URSELF! is a separate song. It's not really an issue as it's the same thing though.

AMHAC has a normal version and a Director's cut version, which has some songs that didn't make it into AMHAC. I recommend listening to the normal version then the director's cut version.
